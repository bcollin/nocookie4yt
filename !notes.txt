- Supports both 'object' and 'iframe' elements.

Evaluation: 

The 2 responsive plugins deal with responsiveness, and I don't see a quick way to hook youtube-nocookie in (especially since they aren't really interested in what a Youtube URL looks like - a missed opportunity, if you ask me).

YouTube-Nocookie seems pretty much useless, it does one thing and it does one thing badly.

Youtube No-Cookie Embed, by its own admission, only works together with another tool, and it would be silly to install that tool just for nocookie behaviour.

Youtube Privacy does some weird things with aspect ratio, but is otherwise well-programmed and complete. It lacks a wrapper for responsiveness though.

I like how it advertises HTTPS, maybe I should mention this in the manual.
